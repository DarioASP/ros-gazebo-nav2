# ü§ñ ROS 2 Navigation Robot with Gazebo & RViz

This project implements a mobile robot simulation using **ROS 2**, described in **URDF/Xacro**, capable of intelligent navigation through a Gazebo-generated map using **Nav2**. The robot is equipped with a simulated **LiDAR sensor** and **camera**, and its behavior is visualized in **RViz2**.
